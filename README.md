##Market Research
To be able to produce a controller, research of existing products is necessary to find out how other production companies and developers have designed their user interface to be compatible with their game choice.

##Ergonomics
To make a controller suited for gaming, the ergonomics of the controller has to be appropriate for people holding it for a long time. If your controller starts to make the player's hands cramp then it's a bad controller and the game won't be played. Another issue with ergonomics is that gamers vary in sizes and so do their hands. To make a tailored controller to fit a large handed man can't fit in the hands of a small handed woman. Therefore an average is taken to make sure that the consumers hand size of varying sizes (within reason) are able to reach the buttons and hold the controller without difficulty.
