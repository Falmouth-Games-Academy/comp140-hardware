BA Game: A Novel Ambition
![BA Game](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaddieK19/comp140-hardware/master/BA%20game%20instructions.png)  
The screenshot above shows the controls for the BA game I've chosen to deisgn my controller for. It requires 4 directional buttons (WASD or arrows), the mouse to aim and throw the crackers and four additional buttons for space, ctrl, shift and esc. The number of buttons required is similar to the amount required on most existing controllers.



###Exsisting Controllers:
The current generation consoles' controllers all have a similar shape:  
#####PS4 controller:

#####XBOX One controller:

#####Steam Controller:

#####Wii U controller:

As all four controllers have a similar basic shape it's likely that a lot of research and testing has been done to decide that that basic shape with two hand grips is ergonomically the best shape. The Wii U also has it's large game pad controller but reviews (link some reviews) suggest that many users favour the pro controller shown above. 

Another issue is that people don't want to adapt how they play to use a radically different controller, they'll want one that is relatively simple to use if they have used other controllers such as the ones above.  Therefore my controller will use this basic shape with two hand grips.
