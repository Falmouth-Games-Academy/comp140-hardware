###Exsisting/Current Controllers:
The current generation consoles' controllers all have a similar shape:  
#####PS4 controller:

#####XBOX One controller:

#####Wii U controller:

As all four controllers have a similar basic shape it's likely that a lot of research and testing has been done to decide that that basic shape with two hand grips is ergonomically the best shape. Also people won't want to adapt how they play to use a radically different controller, they'll want one that is relatively simple to use if they have used other controllers.
