##Market Research
To be able to produce a controller, research of existing products is necessary to find out how other production companies and developers have designed their user interface to be compatible with their game choice.

##Ergonomics
To make a controller suited for gaming, the ergonomics of the controller has to be appropriate for people holding it for a long time. If your controller starts to make the player's hands cramp then it's a bad controller and the game won't be played. Another issue with ergonomics is that gamers vary in sizes and so do their hands. To make a tailored controller to fit a large handed man can't fit in the hands of a small handed woman. Therefore an average is taken to make sure that the consumers hand of varying sizes (within reason) are able to reach the buttons and hold the controller without difficulty.

##Complexity
If a controller is too complex, it can reduce the number of users and the game it is intended for is less. For a game with a casual gamer target audience, a controller with multiple combination buttons can cause frustration with the uses. However, for a veteran player then the complexity is a challenge and the skill of the player improves their usability.

##Connectivity
Most controllers are started to become wireless however some wired controllers still exist. For wireless controllers, it reduces the clutter of storage and also improves the mobility and engagement in the game. However, rechargable or non-rechargable batteries are required and a sync process is needed. There can be other issues with wireless if there require a direct line of sight to a sensor to work if there are obsticles in the way.

##Visual and Audio
Other controllers are through visual and audio sensors, which change the engagement with the player. Depending on the type of game this can improve or decrease this. For a dance game, a visual sensor can make the game seem more intuitive and suited than a standard controller. With singing games, audio sensors do something that a standard controller cannot and actual requires the gamer to user their voice to sing instead of a button. This has also been incorporated into commands in addition to standard controllers such as the Xbox One headset which allows uses to start games, pause movies and shutdown the console with voice control.
