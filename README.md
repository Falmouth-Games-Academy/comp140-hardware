####BA Game: A Novel Ambition

The screenshot above shows the controls for the BA game I've chosen to deisgn my controller for. It requires 4 directional buttons (WASD or arrows), the mouse to aim and throw the crackers and four additional buttons for space, ctrl, shift and esc. The number of buttons required is similar to the amount required on most existing controllers.


###Exsisting Controllers:
The current generation consoles' controllers all have a similar shape:  
#####PS4 controller:

#####XBOX One controller:

#####Wii U controller:

As all four controllers have a similar basic shape it's likely that a lot of research and testing has been done to decide that that basic shape with two hand grips is ergonomically the best shape. The Wii U also has it's large game pad controller but reviews (link some reviews) suggest that many users favour the pro controller shown above. 

Another issue is that people don't want to adapt how they play to use a radically different controller, they'll want one that is relatively simple to use if they have used other controllers such as the ones above.  Therefore my controller will use this basic shape with two hand grips.  

A complaint I often saw about controllers was their size, with such a variety in players it's hard to design a controller that will be comfortable for all players. Therefore I plan to make controller resizeable, most likely only the width will be adustable letting players find a size that is comfortable for them.  The recent xbox elite controller was a customizable controller that despite it's large price tag still sold very well suggesting that many people like to customize their controllers to what fits their play style.

###My controller:  
My controller will use the basic shape with two handgrips that other controllers use. My controller will be wired as it's using the makey makey kit.

The esc key exits the game and therefore needs to be somewhere where the user can't easily press it by accident.
I'll attempt to make a joystick using the MakeyMakey kit for the the aiming the mouse controls.

I also want to make a joystick that is surrounded by a button allowing the player to aim with the joystick then move straight to pressing the fire button.


###First Prototype:  
  
IMAGE OF FIRST PROTOTYPE  

The first prototype was using the Makey Makey kit, I coudln't remap it to use the Shit and Ctrl keys so it's isn't suitable for the game I've chosen therefore I'm going to build my controller using and arduino uno instead. I'm also going to try and experiment with using light senors instead of an analogue stick to aim the firecrackers and I also want to use LEDs that'll flash when a firecracker is thrown.
