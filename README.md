Base repository for the COMP140 Hardware Hacking assignment

The research that I applied to this task was to find the main aspects of game controllers that make them successful in the industry and what made some of them fail. I have only looked into Game Pads more than joysticks and other computer interfaces, as there seems to be a much larger market for them.
I have Chosen the Guillotine Hospital as my game of choice to create a controller for.
To find what my controller needed the easiest thing to do was to look at the largest commercial successes:

These controllers are considered the most successful game pads in existence today.

The main features that these controllers have are:

1. The ergonomic design: 
 * Other than the Nintendo Wii controller the others follow a two handled shape.
2. The presence of an analog stick/sticks
3. Multiple buttons usually consisting of four buttons to the right and a D-Pad, again the Wii controller is different as can be seen by its diagram.

Obviously there are some differences:

1. The 360 controller has back triggers where as the others have rear buttons, this was added in the PS3-4 models. 

2. The Nintendo has a major difference being that its a motion based controller the analog and extra buttons were added for games that didn't require as much movement.

3. The Game Cube's exaggerated buttons were successful as they decided to design them with use in hand, i.e. "A" would be mashed most in a lot of games so it was placed as the biggest.

Other companies have tried to create their own game pads as follows:

These controllers are using the same principles as the others with the presence of the analog stick, four buttons to the right and the rear bumpers. Not to mention the similar shape their all following, as they say don't fix what isn't broken.

Due to the simple nature of the game of choice my controller will follow some of these predetermined qualities that are needed but keeping a simple design:

1.  The inclusion of an analog stick.
2. Four standard buttons.
3. A unique quality.
 * This will follow the Nintendo Wii design for their add-on analog stick.
 * Extra buttons will be added below the analog stick to improve compatibility to the PC.
 * The Basic shape will remain as the ergonomics are already impressive, but improvements will be attempted.
