\section{Two Improvements}
One issue with my controller is likely to be the ergonomics. The throwing star shape means that one side will be shaped similarity to controller such as the PS4 controller and Xbox One controller, this side should be easy to grip and use. However the other side curves upwards which may be hard to grip or may not be able to grip easily. This may lead to the buttons on that side of the controlled being harder to use. 

Another issue is that the controller is not very divergent from controllers currently on the market...
